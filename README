This is an alternate version of the "JSON Input" step that uses Jayway JsonPath
(https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath) instead of a parser based on JavaScript. It
is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the "JSON Input" step but should
be much faster and memory efficient.

Based on the existing "JSON Input" step from Pentaho Data Integration.


To build (requires Apache Maven 3 or later) and install:

mvn package

The plugin will be placed under the plugins/steps/FastJsonInput subdirectory.
Simply copy the FastJsonInput directory to the plugins/steps directory in
your Pentaho Data Integration installation and launch Spoon. The new step
should be available under the "Experimental" category.
